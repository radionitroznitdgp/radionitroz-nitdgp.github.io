    content="We, the People of Radio NITroz of NIT Durgapur, strive to make a difference in the hectic life of college by bringing fun events and help people learn better with a calm mind because “Life is to live”.
    Radio NITroz was formed in the year 2006 by our brilliant seniors and it is the 3rd successful LAN/Internet based Radio among all IITs and NITs. 
    It is a matter of proud for us. We work on the motto to make life a bit easy and fun.
     We have been very popular for our Podcasts and the Live Dedication. There was a time when everyone used to tune into Radio NITroz using VLC and tell us whom they want to dedicate songs and messages if any. 
     It was amazing to be loved by everyone. For this, we carry out different events throughout the year, enthralling people with Joie de vivre.">
